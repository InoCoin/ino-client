In this white paper we present InoCoin, a brand new technology for securely transferring money between anonymous peers. Our solution is based on the Ethereum
codebase and keys/addresses system including multi-signature outputs and ring signatures.

The main purpose of this technology is to help young entrepreneurs and Start-Ups, to secure financing and develop their idea. The technology simultaneously enables anyone to become an investor and earn a return on their investment.

1. Abstract

Unlike others, InoCoin is a universal payment tool but also, aside from serving as a platfrom for obtaining start up capital, it will provide an opportunity for any person to take advantage of the innovation and projects being developed.

InoCoin – the global platform for funding and provision of know-how to young blockchain projects. The currency backed by a mix of people with great technical and commercial skills. People, who will share advice and provide constant direction for young teams in addition to providing funds. A unique decentralized system for joint decision making between the lead team, project representatives and all investors and owners of the currency. Sharing of knowledge, ideas and shares through InoCoin.

2. Blockchain Technology

Historically, transactions have depended on processes that build much needed
trust—that is, each party must offer evidence that it has the capacity to hold up
its end of the bargain. If one party hands over cash, and the other party fails to
deliver the security, serious market inefficiencies arise. Financial intermediaries—
whether for commercial reasons or due to regulatory mandate—have blossomed
in every place that market integrity is lacking, in order to provide assurances
that the markets will function without undue friction. Blockchain technology can resolve
this issue.
For the first time in history, an immutable, decentralized ledger exists on
a global scale, eliminating the need for middlemen, complex auditing systems,
and long settlement times. Open (permissionless) protocols mean settlements no
longer depend on connecting fragmented legacy systems. Additionally, because
the ledger is append-only (existing records are immutable), it provides a high
degree of accountability, with blockchain timestamping built-in. In other words,
a reliable audit trail is built into the technology.
The most commonly used methods for ensuring consensus on a blockchain
are Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. They ensure truthful consensus by making
the costs of manipulating the network greater than the profit to be made from
such deceitful transactions. For example, on the Bitcoin blockchain, the cost
of censoring new transactions at the time of this writing would be billions of
dollars [12]. Few entities have the capability to pull off such an attack, and
as the network grows, the cost of attacks increases, making them increasingly
improbable.
The most popular blockchains are decentralized. Transactions are algorithmic
and the security of the network is maintained by thousands of independent
nodes. Block-chain systems eliminate the need to trust the operators of
a centralized system. Without a single source of truth to lobby, blackmail, or
bribe, the decentralized model greatly reduces the chance of regulatory capture.
Blockchain technology opens the possibility of more transparent markets,
that are less susceptible to the control of financial oligopolies, operating within
a regulatory environment they have helped create.


5. Smart Contracts

Over the past few years, Turing-complete programming languages have been implemented into decentralized blockchains. These systems use “smart contracts” (software programs stored on-chain that are automatically implemented, upon specific conditions being satisfied), to add and modify data algorithmically however a user designs it. This data extends well beyond simple account balances and may include metadata, account restrictions, transfer rules, as well as any other calculations a regular computer can perform. The most widely used Turing-complete blockchain, Ethereum, grew out of a frustration with trying to implement complex logic on top of Bitcoin [13]. Ethereum simplifies the task of implementing complex financial logic on a blockchain. With only a few lines of code, smart contracts can transfer assets or establish escrow conditions to be executed algorithmically, with all the benefits of blockchains as described earlier. In other words, if two parties enter into a smart contract, and each party presents their asset, the transaction is automatically carried out, without risk of failure; if one party fails to present its asset, the other party retains its asset. There is no risk of payment on one side and failure to deliver on the other side. The smart contract can be designed to complete a transaction instantaneously or can be designed to completete upon future conditions begin met.

6. What InoCoin solves?


InoCoin provides every single person a chance to be an investor and innovator. Age, knowledge, wealth etc are not relevant.

All the while InoCoin provides an opportunity to every person with a great idea, but without sufficient finances.

Owing to the fact that InoCoin is an investment platform that connects investors and innovators, enabling them to improve upon new or existing technologies, hence making the world better place. All without any taxes. Everyone with good idea is welcome to share it and we will aid in collecting the finances necessary.
You can register at https://platform.inocoin.eu and take on the role you desire - investor or innovator.




7. Assets:


InoCoin: The core utility tokens that power the InoCoin Platform. An InoCoin is a standard ERC20 token.
InoCoin Chaincode: At the heart of the InoCoin platform are a set of
smart contracts. These serve to coordinate interactions between participants.
InoCoin smart contracts are deployed on Ethereum, but could
be linked to other platforms.







8. Mobile apps :

Our team has developed mobile applications meeting the requirements of the InoCoin Investment Platform. Seeing as we believe that investing should be as easy as possible for potential investors, unlike the complicated process that arises with the old banking system.

You can use our mobile apps on all major operating systems – iOS, Android, Windows and Linux. You can create your own wallets, introduce your own projects and get funding or simply invest in the best start up.





9. Team

InoCoin employs an international team with a vision, ability, innovative thinking, open mindedness, management skills, marketing knowledge, and developers coming from various backgrounds such as IT, accounting, finance, blockchain and more. A complete profile of our team is available at https://www.inocoin.eu

In Blockchain - We are highly experienced blockchain developers, as a result we have built our platform on the Etherum blockhain net. This will elevate investment and crowdfunding to another level.

In Finance - Our Financial team has a huge amount of experience within the banking system and investment area, however we believe that the future is blockchain and it will completely transform the world of investment and entrepreneurship.

In Business - Several large business developers are part of our team. They possess  extensive experience in consulting and helping entrepreneurs grow their business.


10. Token supply:

Token Supply: 1,000,000,000 INO tokens are available for distribution in cryptocurrency markets.
200,000,000 INO are available to contributors.
10,000,000 INO are bound for the team, advisors, bounties etc.
300,000,000 INO tokens will be kept for financing new projects during 2018 and 2019.
The remaining 490,000,000 INO tokens will be kept as a reserve and locked for one year, solely to develop partnerships and future acquisitions and thereby become a dominant market leader.





11.  Road Map


The idea was synthesized during Q4 of 2017. During the time elapsed since, we have created and developed the investment platform InoCoin. This token is not like every other, therefore we will not be making an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). We are aiming to be listed on the public markets and provide everyone with a chance to be a part of this huge project.

By the end of 2018, at least one startup will have been financed and developed with the help of us and our investors.
